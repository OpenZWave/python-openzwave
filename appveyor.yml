# This is so you can login via RDP to the appveyor VM. I needed
# to use this to isolate some issue with the build process for windows.
# appveyor was nice enough to not transfer over all of the registry keys for
# the build tools they have installed into the VM. So I had to locate ones
# that were available that would provide data that would identify some of the
# components needed to build openzwave and libopenzave on windows.

# when you uncomment the lines below. after the build process has completed
# failed or not the program will stop and not exit. It will display
# ip:host, username (always appveyor) and a random password. This is what is
# needed to log into the VM
