Installing python-openzwave from repositories
*********************************************


Install the needed tools
========================

You must install mercurial and subversion to get sources of python-
openzwave and openzwave. Look at the documentation of your Linux
distribution to do that.

On a debian like distribution :

   sudo apt-get install mercurial subversion

You need cython (0.14) to compile the python library
(libopenzwave.pyx). Some users have reported errors when using 0.16 or
0.17. Some 64 bits users reports segfault when using examples. Seems
that using cython 0.15 was the problem. Gentoo users : don't use
cython that is shipped with your distribution.

Install it using pip.

   sudo pip install cython==0.14

You also need some python modules, on a debian like distribution :

   sudo apt-get install python-dev python-setuptools python-louie

You need sphinx and make to generate the documentation.

On a debian like distribution :

   sudo apt-get install python-sphinx make

You also need to install some sphinx contributions :

   sudo pip install sphinxcontrib-blockdiag sphinxcontrib-actdiag
   sudo pip install sphinxcontrib-nwdiag sphinxcontrib-seqdiag

To compile the openzwave library, you need the common builds tools and
the libudev developments headers.

On a debian like distribution :

   sudo apt-get install build-essential libudev-dev g++


Get sources of python-openzwave
===============================

You are now ready to download sources of python-openzwave :

   hg clone https://code.google.com/p/python-openzwave/

The previous command will create a copy of the official repository on
your computer in a directory called python-openzwave.


Update and build process
========================

Go to the previously created directory

   cd python-openzwave

The following command will update your local repository to the last
release of python-openzwave and openzwave.

   ./update.sh

When update process is done, you can compile sources

   ./compile.sh

Or if you have already build python-openzwave in a previous
installation, you can use the clean option to remove old builds.

   ./compile.sh clean


Installation
============

You can now install the packages using the following command will.

   sudo ./install.sh

The installation script create a list of installed files. So you can
remove python-openzwave using the following command :

   sudo ./uninstall.sh
