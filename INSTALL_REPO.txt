Installing python-openzwave from repository
*******************************************


Install the needed tools
========================

You must install git and make to retrieve sources of python-openzwave
and openzwave.

On a debian like distribution :

   sudo apt-get install -y git make


Get sources of python-openzwave
===============================

You are now ready to download sources of python-openzwave :

   git clone https://github.com/OpenZWave/python-openzwave

The previous command will create a copy of the official repository on
your computer in a directory called python-openzwave.


Install dependencies
====================

You need some tools (a c++ compiler, headers dir python, ...) to build
python-openzwave and openzwave library.

On a debian like distribution :

   sudo make repo-deps

For non-debian (fedora, ...), you can retrieve the packages needed in
the Makefile.


Update and build process
========================

Go to the previously created directory

   cd python-openzwave

The following command will update your local repository to the last
release of python-openzwave and openzwave.

   make update

When update process is done, you can compile sources

   make build

Or if you have already build python-openzwave in a previous
installation, you can use the clean target to remove old builds.

   sudo make clean

Do not use root to build python-openzwave as it will surely fails.
Please use a "normal user".


Installation
============

You can now ready to install the eggs using the following command :

   sudo make install

You can also remove python-openzwave using :

   sudo make uninstall


Running tests
=============

You can launch the regression tests using :

   make tests

Keep in mind that the tests will "play" with your nodes : switching on
and off, dimming, adding and removing scenes, ...


About the repositroy
====================

This repository is a development tool, so it might be "unstable" ...
yeah, sometimes it won't build anymore :)

If you want to retrieve the last "good" commit, look at
https://github.com/OpenZWave/python-openzwave/commits/master. The
commits names "Auto-commit for docs" are done after the full process :
build + test + docs, so they might be "working" (almost for me).

You can also build a released version of python-openzwave using tags :

   git tag

   v0.3.0-alpha2
   v0.3.0-alpha3
   v0.3.0-beta1
   v0.3.0-beta2
   v0.3.0a1
