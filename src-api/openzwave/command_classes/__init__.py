# command_class.py
#
# This is a very unique module. It handles a variety of things all at once.
# It provides the user with command class names and it also matches those names
# with a class that represents the actual command class.
#
# By having the classes for each of the command classes it gives an organized
# way of adding code that is specific to a specific command class. it removes
# the need for a method to check a node to see if it is switch, or if you can
# wake it.
#
# this modules when imported for the first time places the instance of a class
# object in sys.modules in place of the actual module it's self. This is done
# to handle the routing of data that is needed to build a node class as well as
# handle user import of command class constants. what I have done is made the
# object act as a dict and when a command class is used in the same fashion as
# you would to get the value from a dict the class representation of the
# command class constant that is passed is returned. If command_class.py is
# imported as a whole i used __getattr__ to return the proper object that is
# being requested. This gives the means to access the objects that are in the
# module without the handler changing anything about.
#
# In the node.py file I have commented on how the nodes are built.
