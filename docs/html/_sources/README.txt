python-openzwave
================

python-openzwave is a python wrapper for the openzwave c++ library : https://github.com/OpenZWave/open-zwave

 * full manager implementation with options
 * an API to map the ZWave network in Python objects
 * a command line manager to manage / debug your ZWave network
 * a full-event webapp example : flask + socket.io + jquery
 * a suite of tests
 * many examples


python-openzwave 0.3.0-b7 is out !!!
====================================
Look at CHANGELOG to see new features and release notes.

Look at INSTALL_REPO to test it now

Look at INSTALL_ARCH to install from archive : no need to install cython anymore


Support
=======
You can ask for support on the google group : http://groups.google.com/d/forum/python-openzwave-discuss.

Please don't ask for support in github issues or by email.


Pull requests
=============
Please read DEVEL documentation before submitting pull request.
A lot of project tasks are done automatically or with makefile, so they must be done in a certain place or in a special order.

Migrating from python-openzwave 0.2.X to 0.3.0
==============================================
I need to update source tree of python-openzwave and modules's names because of a bug in setuptools : https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/issue/230/develop-mode-does-not-respect-src .
Sorry for that.

Update your sources:

.. code-block:: bash

    git pull

Before building python-openzwave 0.3.0, you must uninstall the old version :

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo make uninstall

About cython : I've made many tests using cython installed via pip : (0.20, 0.21 and 0.22).
Compilation is ok but a segfault appears when launching the tests. Please remove it.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo pip uninstall Cython

You also need to make some minor updates in you code, look at CHANGELOG

If you have problems, please submit an issue with :

 - cython -V
 - the content of the directory /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ (for python2.7)
 - the content of /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/easy-install.pth (for python 2.7)


Ubuntu 64bits ... and the others
================================

If you're using Ubuntu 64 bits (and mayde others) and keep your distribution up to date,
you certainly have the segfault problem.

It appears with the last update of python :

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python
    Python 2.7.6 (default, Jun 22 2015, 17:58:13)
    [GCC 4.8.2] on linux2
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.


I've open a discussion on cython-users here : https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/cython-users/mRsviGuCFOk

The only way I found to avoid this is to rebuild and reinstall the old release of python :

.. code-block:: bash

    wget https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archive/primary/+files/python2.7_2.7.6-8.dsc https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archive/primary/+files/python2.7_2.7.6.orig.tar.gz https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archive/primary/+files/python2.7_2.7.6-8.diff.gz

    dpkg-source -x python2.7_2.7.6-8.dsc

    sudo apt-get build-dep python2.7

    cd python2.7-2.7.6

    dpkg-buildpackage

Wait, wait and await again :)

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ..

    sudo dpkg -i *.deb

To prevent future updates of python, you could mark its packages. For example, if you use apt to update your distribution, use the following command :

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-mark hold idle-python2.7 libpython2.7-minimal python2.7-dbg python2.7-minimal libpython2.7 libpython2.7-stdlib python2.7-dev libpython2.7-dbg  libpython2.7-testsuite python2.7-doc libpython2.7-dev python2.7 python2.7-examples

Some users have reported that building python-openzwave using the archive (INSTALL_ARCH) can also do the trick. Let me know if it works for you.
